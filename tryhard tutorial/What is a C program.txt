1. What is a C program?
-	It’s Just a Text File
-	Understandable format language
-	What we refer to as High-Level language OR Human readable language




2. What is RAM? 
-	Random Access Memory
-	It’s computer memory




3. Basic Cycle of how computer made:
-	Fetch -> Decode -> Execute -> Write Back

-	Fetch = Fetch from Memory which will be sent to -> Control Unit (ALU)
- 	Decode = Break down Low-level Language from Memory to OPCODE and OPPREANDS
- 	Execute = Compute the instruction using ALU
- 	Write Back = Send result




4. What is ASCII?
Idea to represent each character with 8 bit (0-255)
0-127 	(Readable Character)
128-255 	(Unreadable Character)
